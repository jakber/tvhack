# NEXTflix
### TLDR
NEXTflix is a Chrome extension that brings that 80's zapping experience to the new TV.

### Longer version
With the new TV we are in total control. What to watch, when, becomes whatever, whenever. But while at first the experience feels like freedom, actually watching anything becomes a chore because you have to make all kinds of decisions that stand in the way of the actual watching experience.

NEXTflix solves that. Watch something and if you don't like it, just hit NEXT.

### Usage
Once the extension is installed, NEXTflix tracks your viewing habits to offer content that matches your taste. 

Hit the NEXT keyboard shortcut, or just press the NEXT button on your remote and NEXTflix does the rest.
