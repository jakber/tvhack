# the pitch
## v 0.1
### TLDR:
Nextflix brings that 80's zapping experience to the new TV.

### Longer version
with the new TV we are in total control. What to watch when, becomes whatever whenever. But while at first the experience feels like freedom, actually watching anything becomes a chore because you have to ~~do all kinds of stuff and~~ make all kinds of decisions that stand in the way of the actual watching experience.
